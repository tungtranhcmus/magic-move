      "Maurits Cornelis Escher (1898-1972) was born in the city palace of Leeuwarden, currently the home of the Princessehof National Museum of Ceramics. After his studies Escher travelled into the wide world. He moved to Italy, where he experienced happy and productive years. He went by donkey into the mountains to capture charming villages and characteristic views. When it got dark, he tied a torch to his buttonhole and sketched the sights of Rome by night. The prints from this period testify to Escher's fascination with striking perspectives and image compilations. After wandering through Switzerland and Belgium he eventually ended up in Baarn. There Escher incorporated his Mediterranean impressions into complex images and impossible worlds. At the end of Escher's journey, with such masterpieces as Belvedere (1958) and Metamorphosis II (1939-1940), he not only shows his technical skills and mathematical illusions: if you look closely, you will also detect his love for the Italian landscape."

    description:
      "Waterfall is a lithograph by the Dutch artist M. C. Escher, first printed in October 1961. It shows a perpetual motion machine where water from the base of a waterfall appears to run downhill along the water path before reaching the top of the waterfall. While most two-dimensional artists use relative proportions to create an illusion of depth, Escher here and elsewhere uses conflicting proportions to create a visual paradox. The watercourse supplying the waterfall (its aqueduct or leat) has the structure of two Penrose triangles. A Penrose triangle is an impossible object designed by Oscar Reutersvärd in 1934, and found independently by Roger Penrose in 1958"

    title: "Cycle",
    description:
      "During 1937, 1938 and 1939 Escher gets more and more fascinated by tessellations, cycles and transformations. In a short period of time he made Metamorphosis I, Development I, Day and Night, Cycle, Sky and Water I and II and Development II. All woodcuts. Cycle, from May 1938, is the only lithograph. In it, a little man emerges out of a gate, seemingly happy. He runs down the stairs, not knowing he will disappear at the bottom, being dissolved in an erratic geometric pattern. But this metamorphosis is not the end. Towards the upper left corner the pattern changes into simpler forms, into cubes, into architecture and finally the cubes resurface as terrace tiles. Somewhere hidden they’re transformed again into the little man, after which the cycle begins again. The hilly landscape at the top is intended to create the largest possible contrast between the threedimensional liberated reality and the restrictions in the two-dimensional pattern at the bottom."

    description:
      "Relativity is a lithograph print by the Dutch artist M. C. Escher, first printed in December 1953. The first version of this work was a woodcut earlier that same year. It depicts a world in which the normal laws of gravity do not apply. The architectural structure seems to be the centre of an idyllic community, with most of its inhabitants casually going about their ordinary business, such as dining. There are windows and doorways leading to park-like outdoor settings. All of the figures are dressed in identical attire and have featureless bulb-shaped heads. Identical characters such as these can be found in many other Escher works."

    description:
      "Metamorphosis I is a woodcut print by the Dutch artist M. C. Escher which was first printed in May, 1937. This piece measures 19.5 cm × 90.8 cm (7 5⁄8 in × 35 3⁄4 in) and is printed on two sheets. The concept of this work is to morph one image into a tessellated pattern, then gradually to alter the outlines of that pattern to become an altogether different image. From left to right, the image begins with a depiction of the coastal Italian town of Atrani (see Atrani, Coast of Amalfi). The outlines of the architecture then morph to a pattern of three-dimensional blocks. These blocks then slowly become a tessellated pattern of cartoon-like figures in oriental attire."

    description:
      "Drawing Hands is a lithograph by the Dutch artist M. C. Escher first printed in January 1948. It depicts a sheet of paper out of which, from wrists that remain flat on the page, two hands rise, facing each other and in the paradoxical act of drawing one another into existence. Although Escher used paradoxes in his works often, this is one of the most obvious examples."
